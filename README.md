# Code

#### 介绍
steganalysis文件夹中包含隐写分析相关的matlab代码和python代码  
以及相关解释  


#### 数据集说明  
PSB普林斯顿分割集，真实世界扫描得来。  
包含20类，共计400个，其中261-280这20个人体模型存在网格问题，所以我们实验一般用380个，  
Li等人用354个  

#### 数字图像隐写分析常用数据集  
1. BOSSBase (BOWS2):
BOSSBase (Break Our Steganographic System) is a widely used dataset for image steganalysis.  
It consists of 10,000 grayscale images in BMP format, with a resolution of 512x512 pixels.  
2. BOWS2: BOWS2 (Break Our Watermarking System) is another dataset commonly used in steganalysis research.  
It contains 10,000 grayscale images in BMP format, with a resolution of 512x512 pixels.  
3. S-UNIWARD: S-UNIWARD is a dataset specifically designed for steganalysis of spatial domain image steganography algorithms.  
It consists of 50,000 grayscale images in BMP format, with a resolution of 512x512 pixels.  
4. HUGO: HUGO is a dataset created for steganalysis of JPEG steganography algorithms.   
It contains 50,000 color images in JPEG format, with a resolution of 512x512 pixels.
